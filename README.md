# 2020 Advent of Code
My "solutions" such as they are for the [2020 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## Getting Started
```sh
git clone git@github.com:agilous/2020-advent-of-code.git
cd 2020-advent-of-code
asdf install # Or your version manager of preference.
```
Then run individual files to see results: `elixir day-01/question-01.exs`
